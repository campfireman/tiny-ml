# TinyML @ TUHH (2025)

The course teaches efficient ML for microcontrollers.

## Labs

[Lab 1](./lab_1/), [Lab 2](./lab_2/) and [Lab 3](./lab_3/) taught basics on how to train and optimize ML models for classifying movements based on accelerometer data.

## Projects

Finally, we were allowed us to choose our own project. The [project pitch](./docs/ture_claussen_tinyml_project_pitch.pdf) shows more details, but in summary, I built keyword spotting on an Arduino Nano ESP32.
